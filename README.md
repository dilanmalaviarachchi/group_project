Our group project is a website dedicated to promoting and selling organic fruits and vegetables, developed using Java for backend functionality and HTML/CSS for frontend design. 
The website features a secure login page for customers to access exclusive content and features, including a wide selection of organic produce with detailed descriptions and prices. 
Built with a focus on user experience, the website offers intuitive navigation and responsive design for seamless access across devices. Our aim is to provide customers with a convenient 
platform to purchase high-quality organic produce while leveraging Java's robust backend capabilities and HTML/CSS's versatility in frontend development.
